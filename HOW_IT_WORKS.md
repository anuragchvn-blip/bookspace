## 🔧 Smart Contract Architecture

### **BookmarkRegistry.sol** (Polygon)
```solidity
// Main contract for storing bookmarks
contract BookmarkRegistry {
    // Mapping: user address => array of bookmark URLs
    mapping(address => string[]) public bookmarks;
    
    // Function to add a bookmark
    function addBookmark(string memory url) public {
        bookmarks[msg.sender].push(url);
        emit BookmarkAdded(msg.sender, url);
    }
    
    // Function to get user's bookmarks
    function getBookmarks(address user) public view returns (string[] memory) {
        return bookmarks[user];
    }
}
```

**Key Functions:**
- `addBookmark(url)` - Store a new bookmark on-chain
- `getBookmarks(user)` - Retrieve all bookmarks for a user
- `updateBookmark(index, url)` - Update existing bookmark
- `deleteBookmark(index)` - Remove a bookmark

### **SpaceRegistry.sol** (Polygon)
```solidity
// Contract for premium spaces
contract SpaceRegistry {
    struct Space {
        string name;
        string description;
        address owner;
        uint256 accessPrice; // in wei (MATIC)
        bool isPublic;
        uint256 createdAt;
    }
    
    mapping(uint256 => Space) public spaces;
    mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => bool)) public members;
    
    // Create a new space
    function createSpace(
        string memory name,
        string memory description,
        uint256 accessPrice,
        bool isPublic
    ) public payable {
        // Space creation logic
    }
    
    // Join a space (pay to access)
    function joinSpace(uint256 spaceId) public payable {
        require(msg.value >= spaces[spaceId].accessPrice, "Insufficient payment");
        members[spaceId][msg.sender] = true;
        // Transfer payment to space owner
    }
}
```

**Key Functions:**
- `createSpace()` - Create a new bookmark collection
- `joinSpace(spaceId)` - Pay to access premium content
- `checkMembership(spaceId, user)` - Verify access rights
- `updateSpace()` - Modify space details (owner only)

### **DirectMessageRegistry.sol** (Polygon)
```solidity
// Contract for DM access management
contract DirectMessageRegistry {
    uint256 public constant DM_ACCESS_PRICE = 1 ether; // 1 POL
    
    mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) public dmAccess;
    
    // Purchase unlimited DM access to someone
    function purchaseDMAccess(address recipient) public payable {
        require(msg.value >= DM_ACCESS_PRICE, "Send 1 POL");
        dmAccess[msg.sender][recipient] = true;
        // Transfer to recipient
    }
    
    // Check if sender can DM recipient
    function checkDMAccess(address sender, address recipient) public view returns (bool) {
        return dmAccess[sender][recipient];
    }
}
```

## 👤 User Journey

### **Step 1: Connect Wallets**
```
User arrives at BookSpace homepage
↓
Clicks "Connect Wallet" button
↓
Connects MetaMask (Polygon) for bookmarks/spaces
↓
Connects Phantom (Solana) for tips
```

**Why two wallets?**
- **Polygon**: Low-cost storage, permanent data
- **Solana**: Fast, cheap micropayments for tips

### **Step 2: Create First Bookmark**
```
User clicks "Create Space" or "Dashboard"
↓
Navigates to create page
↓
Selects "Bookmark" type
↓
Fills form:
  - URL (required)
  - Title
  - Description
  - Tags
  - Space (optional - which collection)
↓
Clicks "Create Bookmark"
↓
MetaMask popup appears
↓
User approves transaction (~0.01 MATIC gas)
↓
Bookmark stored on Polygon blockchain forever!
```

**What happens on-chain:**
1. Transaction calls `addBookmark(url)` on BookmarkRegistry contract
2. Bookmark data stored in your personal array
3. IPFS metadata uploaded (title, description, tags)
4. Event emitted: `BookmarkAdded(user, url, ipfsHash)`
5. Transaction confirmed (~2-5 seconds on Polygon)

### **Step 3: Create Premium Space**
```
User clicks "Create Space"
↓
Selects "Space" type
↓
Fills form:
  - Space Name (e.g., "Web3 Dev Resources")
  - Description
  - Access Price (e.g., 5 MATIC)
  - Public/Private toggle
↓
Clicks "Create Space"
↓
MetaMask transaction approval
↓
Space created on-chain
↓
User can now add bookmarks to this space
```

**What happens on-chain:**
1. `createSpace()` function called
2. Space metadata stored in SpaceRegistry
3. User becomes space owner
4. Access price set (e.g., 5 MATIC = $2.50)
5. Space gets unique ID (e.g., spaceId: 1)

### **Step 4: Other Users Join Space**
```
User discovers space on Dashboard/Browse
↓
Clicks "Join Space" button
↓
Sees price: "5 MATIC"
↓
Clicks "Pay & Join"
↓
MetaMask popup: Send 5 MATIC
↓
User approves transaction
↓
Payment sent to space owner
↓
User gains access to all bookmarks in space!
```

**What happens on-chain:**
1. `joinSpace(spaceId)` called with 5 MATIC attached
2. Contract checks: `msg.value >= accessPrice`
3. User added to members mapping: `members[1][userAddress] = true`
4. 5 MATIC transferred to space owner
5. User can now view all bookmarks in that space

### **Step 5: Receive Tips**
```
Someone loves your curated bookmarks
↓
Clicks "Tip SOL" button on your profile
↓
Modal opens: "Send tip to @yourname"
↓
Enters amount: 0.1 SOL
↓
Adds message: "Great resources!"
↓
Clicks "Send Tip"
↓
Phantom wallet popup
↓
Approves 0.1 SOL transfer
↓
You receive 0.1 SOL instantly! (~400ms on Solana)
```

### **Step 6: Unlock Direct Messages**
```
User wants to message you
↓
Clicks "Send Message"
↓
Sees: "Pay 1 POL to unlock unlimited DMs"
↓
Clicks "Pay & Unlock"
↓
MetaMask: Send 1 POL
↓
Transaction confirmed
↓
Now can send unlimited messages to you
```

**What happens on-chain:**
1. `purchaseDMAccess(recipientAddress)` called
2. 1 POL sent with transaction
3. Access granted: `dmAccess[sender][recipient] = true`
4. Recipient receives 1 POL
5. Off-chain messaging system checks on-chain access
6. Messages stored in IPFS, access verified on-chain

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Is my data really permanent?**
A: Yes! Once written to blockchain, it cannot be deleted by anyone, including us.

**Q: What if Polygon gas fees spike?**
A: Polygon is a Layer 2 with very low fees (~$0.01 per transaction). Even in congestion, it stays cheap.

**Q: Can I migrate my bookmarks later?**
A: Yes! Export bookmarks anytime. They're on-chain, you own them forever.

**Q: What happens if BookSpace shuts down?**
A: Your data remains on blockchain. Any app can read it using the smart contract address.

**Q: How do I earn from my spaces?**
A: Set an access price (e.g., 5 MATIC). When others join, payment goes directly to your wallet.
