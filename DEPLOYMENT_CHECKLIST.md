---

## üîß STEP 1: DEPLOY SMART CONTRACTS

### A. Setup Hardhat
```powershell
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Verify hardhat.config.js has correct network settings
# Should have "amoy" network with Polygon RPC
```

### B. Deploy to Polygon Amoy Testnet
```powershell
# Run deployment script
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-polygon.ts --network amoy
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Deploying contracts...
BookmarkRegistry deployed to: 0xABCD1234...
DirectMessageRegistry deployed to: 0xEFGH5678...
Deployment complete!

Contract Addresses Saved:
NEXT_PUBLIC_BOOKMARK_REGISTRY_ADDRESS=0xABCD1234...
NEXT_PUBLIC_DM_REGISTRY_ADDRESS=0xEFGH5678...
```

### C. Save Contract Addresses
- [ ] Copy `BookmarkRegistry` address
- [ ] Copy `DirectMessageRegistry` address
- [ ] Update `.env.local` with both addresses
- [ ] Update `src/config/constants.ts` with addresses

### D. Verify Contracts on PolygonScan
```powershell
# Verify BookmarkRegistry
npx hardhat verify --network amoy 0xABCD1234...

# Verify DirectMessageRegistry  
npx hardhat verify --network amoy 0xEFGH5678...
```

**File: `src/config/constants.ts`**
```typescript
// Replace with your deployed addresses
export const BOOKMARK_REGISTRY_ADDRESS = '0xABCD1234...' // From deployment
export const DM_REGISTRY_ADDRESS = '0xEFGH5678...' // From deployment
```

### B. Update Environment Variables
**File: `.env.local`**
```env
# Contract Addresses (from deployment)
NEXT_PUBLIC_BOOKMARK_REGISTRY_ADDRESS=0xABCD1234...
NEXT_PUBLIC_DM_REGISTRY_ADDRESS=0xEFGH5678...

# Polygon Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_POLYGON_RPC_URL=https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology/

## üîç VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

### Smart Contracts

https://www.oklink.com/amoy/address/0xYourBookmarkRegistryAddress

# Verify contract is verified (green checkmark)
# Check contract has "Read Contract" and "Write Contract" tabs
```

- [ ] Correct contract addresses
- [ ] ABI matches deployed contract
- [ ] Transactions confirm on blockchain
- [ ] Events are emitted properly

---

## üö® TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Contract not deployed"
**Cause:** Deployment failed or address not updated  
**Fix:** Re-run `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-polygon.ts --network amoy`

### "Transaction failed: insufficient funds"
**Cause:** Not enough MATIC for gas  
**Fix:** Get more test MATIC from https://faucet.polygon.technology/

### "Wrong network"
**Cause:** MetaMask on wrong network  
**Fix:** Switch to Polygon Amoy in MetaMask

### "Frontend not connecting to contract"
**Cause:** Contract address mismatch  
**Fix:** Verify addresses in `constants.ts` match deployed addresses

### "Build fails on Vercel"
**Cause:** Missing environment variables  
**Fix:** Add all `.env.local` variables to Vercel dashboard
