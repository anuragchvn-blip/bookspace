## üìù STEP 1: SET UP YOUR WALLETS

### A. Install MetaMask (for Polygon - Required)

**IMPORTANT:** MetaMask supports MULTIPLE networks including Polygon. You don't need a separate "Polygon wallet" - one MetaMask wallet works for everything!

1. Go to https://metamask.io
2. Download and install:
   - **Desktop:** Browser extension (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Brave)
   - **Mobile:** MetaMask app from App Store or Google Play
3. Create new wallet or import existing one
4. **SAVE YOUR 12-WORD SEED PHRASE!** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Write it on paper (NOT screenshot!)
   - Store in safe place
   - This lets you access your bookmarks from ANY device
   - If you lose it, you lose access FOREVER

5. **Add Polygon Amoy Testnet:**
   - Click network dropdown (top of MetaMask)
   - Click "Add Network" ‚Üí "Add network manually"
   - Fill in:
     * Network Name: `Polygon Amoy Testnet`
     * RPC URL: `https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology/`
     * Chain ID: `80002`
     * Currency Symbol: `MATIC`
     * Block Explorer: `https://www.oklink.com/amoy`
   - Click "Save"

6. **Get Free Test MATIC:**
   - Visit: https://faucet.polygon.technology/
   - Enter your wallet address (copy from MetaMask)
   - Select "Amoy Testnet"
   - Click "Submit" - You'll receive 0.5 MATIC (free!)

**‚úÖ Your wallet address (0xABC123...) is your identity across ALL devices!**

### B. Install Phantom (for Solana Tips - Optional)
1. Go to https://phantom.app
2. Download browser extension
3. Create new wallet
4. Switch to **Devnet** in settings
5. Get free test SOL: https://solfaucet.com/

---

## üîó STEP 2: CONNECT YOUR WALLETS

### Access Your Bookmarks from ANYWHERE! üåç

**The Magic:** Your bookmarks are tied to your wallet address (0xABC123...), NOT to your device or browser!

**This means:**
- ‚úÖ Create bookmark on laptop ‚Üí See it on phone immediately
- ‚úÖ Join space on desktop ‚Üí Access on tablet automatically  
- ‚úÖ Same wallet = Same data everywhere
- ‚úÖ Works in any country, any device, any browser

### How to Connect:

1. Go to BookSpace homepage (from ANY device)
2. Click **"Connect Wallet"** in top right
3. Two wallet buttons appear:
   - **"Connect Polygon"** ‚Üí Click and approve in MetaMask
     * First time: MetaMask popup asks permission
     * Approve ‚Üí Wallet connected!
   - **"Connect Solana"** ‚Üí Click and approve in Phantom (optional for tips)
4. You'll see your connected addresses at the top

**üí° Pro Tip:** Install MetaMask on ALL your devices using the SAME seed phrase, and your bookmarks will sync automatically!

   ‚óè Private (Paid - users pay to access)
   
   Access Price: 5 MATIC
   ```
3. Click **"Create Space"**

   Recipient: 0x123... (space owner)
   Gas Fee: ~0.01 MATIC
   Total: 5.01 MATIC
   ```

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Transaction Failed" in MetaMask:
- **Cause:** Not enough MATIC for gas
- **Fix:** Get more test MATIC from faucet

### "Bookmark Not Appearing":
- **Cause:** Transaction still pending
- **Fix:** Wait 10-30 seconds, refresh page

### "Can't Connect Wallet":
- **Cause:** Wrong network selected
- **Fix:** Switch to Polygon Amoy in MetaMask

### "Space Creation Failed":
- **Cause:** Access price too high (limit: 1000 MATIC)
- **Fix:** Use reasonable price (1-100 MATIC)

### "Payment Not Received":
- **Cause:** Transaction pending or failed
- **Fix:** Check transaction on PolygonScan with transaction hash

## üéì FAQ

**Q: Is my data really permanent?**  
A: Yes! Blockchain data cannot be deleted. As long as Polygon exists, your bookmarks exist.

A: The smart contract has a "soft delete" that marks it as deleted in the UI, but the data remains on-chain.

**Q: What if I lose my wallet?**  
A: You lose access to your bookmarks. ALWAYS back up your seed phrase securely.

**Q: Can I export my bookmarks?**  
A: Yes, you can query the blockchain to get all your bookmarks as JSON.

**Q: How much can I earn?**  
A: Depends on value provided. Some power users earn $100-500/month, most casual users earn $10-50/month.

**Q: When is mainnet launch?**  
A: After thorough testing on testnet. Follow our Twitter for updates.

**Q: Are there platform fees?**  
A: NO! You keep 100% of earnings. We only charge blockchain gas fees (paid to miners, not us).

**Q: Can I use this for illegal content?**  
A: No. While decentralized, illegal activity may have legal consequences.
